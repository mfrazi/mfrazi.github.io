I believe that we all strive to become better than we were yesterday, even if we are not always aware of it. According to Aristotle's concept of *Eudaimonia*, we are constantly pursuing ***'what is worthwhile in life'***. One of the most effective ways to achieve this is by building habits.

Will Durant summarized Aristotle's thoughts on virtue and habit in his book The Story of Philosophy, stating:
> *"We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit."*.

In this post, I would like to share my experience in building habits based on James Clear's book, [_Atomic Habits_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40121378-atomic-habits). For more articles on habit-building by James Clear, you can visit [his website](https://jamesclear.com/articles).

Building habits is not just about starting something new; it's also about stopping behaviors that no longer serve you. In this post, I will summarize and briefly share examples of how you can start a habit using the framework from Atomic Habits.

Here are some key points that will serve as a starting point to shape your perspective and mindset on how habit-building works
1. **Build habits by focusing on _who you want to become_, not just what you want to do.** Instead of saying, _‚ÄúI want to run a 5K,‚Äù_ say, _‚ÄúI want to become a runner‚Äù_ or _‚ÄúI want to be a healthy person.‚Äù_
2. **Tiny improvements (1% better every day) lead to massive results over time.** Progress isn't always visible at first, but small habits compound and create long-term change.
3. **Stick to habits that are challenging but not too difficult** to maintain motivation and prevent burnout.
4. **If you break a habit once, get back on track immediately** to avoid falling into a cycle of inconsistency.

Next, there are four key principles‚Äî_The Four Laws of Behavior Change_‚Äîthat you can follow to start building habits. For this example, I will share how you can apply them to develop a reading habit
### 1. Make It Obvious (Cue)
- **Use visual cues.** If you want to build a reading habit, keep the book you want to read in a visible area‚Äîfor example, on your bed (though not ideal, it increases the chances of noticing it).
- **Set a specific time and align it with your daily routine (habit stacking).** You can say, _‚ÄúI will read one page before going to bed‚Äù_ or _‚ÄúI will read one page after breakfast.‚Äù_ You can also set a timer as a reminder.
### 2. Make It Attractive (Craving)
- **Choose a book that excites you.** If you don't enjoy non-fiction, don't force yourself to start with that genre‚Äîpick something you truly find interesting.
- **Create a cozy reading environment.** Read in a comfortable space, turn on the AC, or use an air freshener to make the experience more relaxing and enjoyable.
### 3. Make It Easy (Response)
- **Start small.** As mentioned earlier, begin with just one page a day. Consistency matters more than quantity.
- **Choose short books to build confidence and momentum.** Completing a book quickly can motivate you to keep going.
- **Find the format that works best for you.** Whether it's a physical book, an e-book, or even an audiobook, choose what feels most convenient and enjoyable.
###  4. Make It Satisfying (Reward)
- **Reward yourself after finishing a book.** Treat yourself to a nice coffee, or buy a new book to keep the momentum going.
- **Track your progress.** Seeing your growth over time can be motivating and reinforce your habit.

Quick reminder: While I mentioned ***"don't force yourself"***, starting a habit often requires stepping out of your comfort zone. As mentioned in point 3 above, ***"stick to habits that are challenging but not too difficult"***. With that in mind, here are four other small habits you can start right now:
### 1. Walking
Walking every day can help reduce stress while also helping you meet the recommended daily step count‚Äîsome suggest 10,000 steps, while others say 5,000 is enough. If you sit all day, this is a great habit to start. You don't need a special device to track your steps; in this modern era, your phone can do it for you.
### 2. Track expense
Every day, you spend money‚Äîwhether on essentials or non-essentials. If you don't track your expenses, you're less likely to understand where your money is going. For example, you might not realize how much you spend on coffee each month. By tracking your finances, you can make better decisions about how to use your money. I personally use [Money Manager](https://www.realbyteapps.com/) (_not an ad, but this app does a great job!_ üòÉ) to track my income and expenses because it's simple and easy to use. Plus, you can access it on a PC for a more detailed view of your finances.
### 3. [Duolingo](https://duolingo.com)
It is one of the most successful apps for learning a new language or improving your current skills. Learning another language can shape your understanding of how people think and perceive the world. The app encourages users to build a habit through its habit tracker and gamification features, allowing you to compete with others by earning as many XP (experience points) as possible.
### 4. Daily journal
When nothing out of the ordinary happens, we tend to forget what we did during the day. However, you can give each day more meaning by writing just one sentence about how you felt or what you accomplished. Journaling serves as a valuable tool for reflection and a way to express your emotions. There are many free apps available to help you with this, such as [OneNote](https://onenote.com). For advanced users, [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) is a great option.

Lastly, based on my experience, here are some additional tips that may help you when starting to build a habit:
- **Just write it down** (even better if you do it on paper) when you're struggling to find motivation to start a new habit.
- **Don't overcomplicate the process.** I used to spend too much time searching for apps or the best tools to help me get started. Most of the time, it just wasted my time. It's better to start with what you already have‚Äîbecause, in most cases, what you have is already enough. The four examples above don't require you to spend any money to get started.

I hope this brief post helps you start building your own habits so that we can become better versions of ourselves and positively influence those around us.
