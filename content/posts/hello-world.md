It has been a while since I wrote any content. I have rarely posted updates on social media over the past seven years since I graduated from university and started working. So yeah, let's begin this new journey here.

There are two main reasons why I need to start writing:
1. When looking on the internet, you may come across articles claiming that Indonesia's reading interest ranks among the lowest in the world according to a *UNESCO* report. Unfortunately, I couldn't find any official report from *UNESCO* to support these claims. However, there are other reports that compare Indonesia's literacy with that of other countries, such as: [# PISA 2022 Results (Volume I and II) - Country Notes: Indonesia](https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/pisa-2022-results-volume-i-and-ii-country-notes_ed6fbcc5-en/indonesia_c2e1ae0e-en.html).

   In short, the younger generation's performance, as reflected in PISA test scores, falls far below the standard and has been declining compared to previous results. This trend is deeply concerning, as the future of this nation rests in their hands.
2. I was a bookworm during my school years. I remember that during holidays, I could finish one book in 2–3 days. However, since starting work and living in this fast-paced digital era, my interest in reading and writing has declined. In recent years, I started reading again, and oh boy, there are so many things you miss and fail to understand without it. Through this blog, I hope to share insights from the books I read with a wider audience, particularly the next generation of Indonesians. Additionally, by writing about what I read, I aim to practice and deepen my understanding of the material.

Even so, I plan not only to share what I read but also to share my opinions, experiences, knowledge, and perspectives with all of you. My main interests include technology, finance, self-improvement, social issues, and photography.

In this year, 2025—already a quarter into the 21st century (_time flies so fast for the millennial generation_)—I aim to write at least 12 articles, one for each month.

Finally, in this fast-paced era, I hope this blog can inspire a greater interest in reading, encourage a break from the constant flow of social media content, and provide meaningful insights.
