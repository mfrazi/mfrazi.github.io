I'm not the most enthusiastic hiker, but I have visited some well-known mountains in Indonesia over the past eight years. In this post, I will focus on what to bring when hiking in Indonesia, drawing on my personal experiences. Since I use an organizer for my trips, I will not discuss broader logistics, such as food, tents, or stoves. Instead, I want to provide you with a clear list of essential personal gear to help you prepare for your hike.

### Backpack
In Indonesia, we can categorize two types of organizers: open trip (OT) or private trip. In this case, I will focus on OT, where you will mostly hike with strangers and bring your own gear, except that you hire a porter. To carry our gear, we need a proper backpack with a minimum capacity of around 30-40 liters . There are numerous options available, ranging from local backpacks starting at around Rp 300,000 to renowned and imported brands costing more than Rp 4 million. If this is your first hike and you have no plans to hike in the near future, it's better to rent one, with the downside that you can't choose the type freely, and most rentals don't provide a high-quality backpack. But if our weight is just less than 6 kg, we can't tell the difference.
If you want to buy it, consider investing in a high-quality and already proven brand. Most hiking backpacks prioritize functionality, and you generally get what you pay for. Also, ensure your backpack has a rain cover, as not all brands include it when you purchase it. I still use [Deuter Futura 36 L Pro](https://www.deuter.com/int-en/shop/backpacks/p824874-hiking-backpack-futura-pro-36) (the one that I use is different from the current version, it still uses [2020's logo](https://1000logos.net/deuter-logo/)) that I bought in 2017, except I need to find a replacement for the rain cover; the bag itself is still in quite good condition. Please note that you need to take care of it, and I always wash it after every use.  Lastly, the reason you need a high-quality backpack is that you want it to be durable, avoiding damage such as a broken zip or snag.

### Sleeping bag
Most camp areas in Indonesia's mountains have temperatures above 10 degrees Celsius, except for some locations during the dry season, which can drop below zero. Choosing the right sleeping bag is a key factor in maintaining your mind and body. A sleeping bag with a comfort rating of around 10 degrees Celsius is generally sufficient. You don't need to buy the warmest sleeping bag out there, because sometimes it's just too warm. Also, it's more pricey and adds more weight to your backpack.  Instead, to adjust your warm comfort, you can add a layer to your body, such as wearing a jacket, using dry socks, or wearing gloves when you sleep.

### Sleeping pad
You also need a sleeping pad to use under your sleeping bag so that you will not sleep directly on the ground. It's very useful for blocking cold and adding comfort. During the last hike to Kerinci, one of the open trip participants lost his mattress on the way and couldn't sleep all night due to the cold on the ground. Most hikers in Indonesia bring a [this kind of mattress](https://blog.eigeradventure.com/matras-gunung/), with the downside that it's quite large if you use a backpack under 40 L, but it can serve as a structure for your backpack. Another option is an aluminum mattress that folds, which is very light but not as comfortable as the previous mattress. The best option is an inflatable mattress, which is usually lightweight, compact, and very comfortable; however, it is also the most expensive option. The choice is yours as long as you bring it.

### Shoes
Most hiking tracks here are just dirt, with some exceptions, such as treks out of vegetation (like the trek to the summit in Rinjani), which consist of sand and rocks. Wearing the right shoes is one way to protect your feet on the hike. From my experience, you need a shoe that doesn't squeeze your feet but also is not too loose. When buying a shoe, it's essential to try it on first and also use it with the same type of shock that you will experience when hiking. Sometimes the weather is very unpredictable, and another option you can consider is to find a really waterproof shoes. It's very useful when heavy rain comes. When you hike with wet feet, it feels very uncomfortable, and you are also prone to other dangers, such as hypothermia.

### Socks
The good socks, not least important, prevent blisters and chafing. To add waterproofing to your feet, consider looking for waterproof socks. Besides using it with your shoes, you will need to bring another sock, either as a backup or to wear when you sleep. Make sure you put this backup sock in a dry bag or other containers so that even if heavy rain hits your backpack, it will still dry.

### Clothes
Wearing the right shirt is also one of the keys to a comfortable hike. You don't have to buy an expensive hiking shirt; just ensure the materials are suitable. Criteria like quick dry are a must, just like most sports shirts that use polyester. Avoid using a cotton-based shirt, as it will absorb your sweat. With some exceptions, certain brands utilize technology that allows for the use of cotton in sports clothing. Other than that, if you need to hike at night (ex, summit attack) or just want to add more layers, you can wear fleece to add warmth to your body. For pants, also look for light and quick-dry options. Heavy-duty pants like [Fjallraven trousers](https://www.fjallraven.com/uk/en-gb/men/trousers/) are not suitable in most mountains, because when the track becomes muddy, even if it's waterproof and very durable, the mud will stick to the pants and they will become heavy, hindering your hike. Lastly, don't forget to bring a backup, at least one shirt, and a pair of pants.

### Glove
Very useful when hiking at night, usually for a summit attack. Also, when you are in the camp area, it will keep you warm. Choose a glove with fleece inside and avoid wearing it if it's wet. If you have a larger budget, consider waterproof gloves so you can use them in rainy weather. Other than to make you warm, there is a [kind glove](https://hikenrun.com/collections/naturehike-outdoors/products/sarung-tangan-outdoor-naturehike-gl09-t-nh21fs035-anti-uv-gloves) that you can use when you hike, to protect your hand when you hold something, like a thorn on a tree. Additionally, this type of glove helps keep your hands clean.

### Raincoat
You don't have to buy a fancy raincoat. For most situations during a hike, you can use a one-time-use raincoat (not very environmentally friendly) for a cost of around ten thousand rupiah. At least it will protect your upper body from the rain, and it's very lightweight, allowing you to simply snap it into your backpack without adding extra weight.

### Dry Bag
Based on my experience, a dry bag is a must. Once, most of my gears got wet even though I had already used a rain cover in my backpack, and I couldn't sleep well. You can put your sleeping bag, clothes, and other gear that must dry in it. It's not cheap for a light and durable dry bag, but it's very worth it. There is a very cheap option, which is to use a trash bag. Put and wrap all your gear in it, and to make it safer, use two trash bags.

### Trekking pole
A trekking pole is very helpful if you are just starting to hike, as it adds support by distributing weight to the upper body. Knowing the trek is also another point to consider; trekking poles are not helpful and not suitable for all treks, and sometimes become a burden, for example, when you climb a cliff that requires both hands. The most helpful use of this trekking pole is when hiking on steep dirt and on sandy terrain, just like most summit treks of volcanoes in Indonesia.

### Sunscreen
Don't be lazy to use sunscreen; it's very easy to just slip it into your backpack. Based on my experience, you can easily ignore it because you feel the weather is cold, but the sun still causes a burn on your face and neck. And now there's a better product, like roll-on sunscreen, that you can apply easily, just like using deodorant; you don't have to use your dirty hands.

### Sandal
The last thing that I feel essential to bring is a sandal. Instead of wearing shoes, especially if your shoes are very dirty with mud and wet, you can use sandals when walking around the camp. Make sure that the sandal you use is not too slippery.  In Indonesia, Swallow is a well-known sandal brand, and using it is sufficient for walking around the camp. Even the Rinjani porters use that kind of sandal all the way, from base camp to the camp area, and even to the summit; you don't need to try this.

That's the list of all the gears that I must bring on all my hikes. In addition to these essentials, you can also bring other items to make your hike more comfortable, such as sunglasses, a pillow, a gaiter, a first aid kit, a headlamp, and a bandana. You can research it and adjust it according to your own preference and the mountain terrain itself. In the next post, I will share my experience with the physical preparation.
